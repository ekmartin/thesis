\chapter{Benchmarks}\label{chap:benchmarks}

Soup includes a series of benchmarks designed to reproduce different real world
workloads where usage of Soup might be appropriate. Additionally, this thesis
introduces a couple of benchmarks that make it easier to see the positive and
negative effects of the specific changes introduced.

\section{Hardware}

\todo{move this to the evaluation section}
Unless otherwise specified, benchmarks are run on Dell PowerEdge R430 server
with two Intel Xeon E5-2660 v3 CPUs and a total of 20 physical and 40 logical
cores. The server has 64GB of DDR4 RAM running at a speed of 2200MHz, and two
solid-state drives: a Samsung SSD 850 PRO and an Intel SSD S3710. The server
runs Arch Linux.

\section{Lobsters}

Lobsters\furl{http://lobste.rs/} is a news aggregation website built using Ruby
on Rails, backed by MySQL.\@ Soup's Lobsters benchmark re-uses the queries run
by the real Lobsters application, modeled after Lobsters production traffic to
best resemble the actual workload the Lobsters servers face.
