\section*{Preface}

This thesis was written as the final deliverable for the Master's of Science in
Computer Science program at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
The program includes a master's thesis---presented here---and a preliminary
project, where the former builds upon research of the latter, which was
completed in December 2017. Both the preliminary project and this thesis
contributes to the Soup research project at MIT's Parallel and Distributed
Operating Systems Group and is advised by Kjetil Nørvåg at NTNU's Department of
Computer Science.

\subsection*{Acknowledgments}

Neither this thesis, nor the research performed in the preliminary project,
would have seen the light of day without the steadfast support, advice, and
feedback from Jon Gjengset, Malte Schwarzkopf, and the rest of the Soup team at
MIT's Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems Group. Thank you for proposing
interesting challenges, providing servers for benchmarks, following up on both
technical and academic questions, and most importantly, for letting me
contribute to Soup---it has been a privilege.

Finally, I would like to thank Kjetil Nørvåg for both excellent advice and
guidance throughout the last year.
