TODO:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Generate proper graphs (either SVG or something like tikz)
  \item Add more explanatory figures
\end{itemize}

Potential questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How often should references to previous sections be included? E.g., if a
    phrase described in the Background section is used later on, should that
    immediately warrant a reference to section x.x.x?
\end{itemize}
