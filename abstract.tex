  \item Background Soup: transactions?
  \item Background Soup: operators
  \item Background Soup: example/API
  \item Possibly move WAL section from 6.1 to Background Soup

Potential questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How often should references to previous sections be included? E.g., if a
    phrase described in the Background section is used later on, should that
    immediately warrant a reference to section x.x.x?
\end{itemize}
